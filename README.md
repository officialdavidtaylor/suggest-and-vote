This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purpose

I needed a way for family members to suggest movies for our movie night, then let everyone vote on them.

Low-res designs took 30min in [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/suggest-and-vote-YPGsi4q4agXdrjz1wMU2Eo).

Dev work still underway - to be updated soon!
